My name is George Do and I am currently studying cyber security as a sophomore. I was born in Nghe An province but now reside in the capital city of Hanoi.

This blog is where I share my knowledge on topics related to mathematics, CTF, and other interesting fields. In my free time, I enjoy playing CTF with the [Double K](https://ctftime.org/team/278424) team.

If you have any questions or comments about my articles, please feel free to email me at *"contact.georgedo@gmail.com"*. Thank you very much for visiting my blog.
